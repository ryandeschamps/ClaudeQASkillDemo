Test Script: TS-053 - View All Orders (Admin)

Test Scenario: As an admin user, I want to view a list of all orders with their statuses, so that I can monitor order fulfillment.

Prerequisites:
- Admin user is logged into admin panel
- System has orders in the database
- Orders exist with various statuses (Open, Confirmed, In Process, Shipped, Delivered)

Test Data:
- Admin User: admin@apparelstore.com
- Sample Orders:
  - ORD-10001 (Open, $59.98)
  - ORD-10002 (Confirmed, $129.99)
  - ORD-10003 (In Process, $74.99)
  - ORD-10004 (Shipped, $99.99)
  - ORD-10005 (Delivered, $149.99)

Test Steps:

GIVEN the admin user is logged into the admin panel
WHEN the admin views the admin dashboard
THEN the dashboard should display a navigation menu
AND the menu should include an "Order Management" option

GIVEN the admin sees the navigation menu
WHEN the admin clicks on "Order Management"
THEN the system should navigate to the Order Management page
AND the page should display the orders list interface

GIVEN the admin is on the Order Management page
WHEN the page loads
THEN the page should display a table or list of all orders
AND the display should include the following columns:
  - Order ID
  - Customer Name
  - Order Date
  - Order Status
  - Total Amount
  - Payment Status
  - Actions (View, Edit buttons)

GIVEN the orders list is displayed
WHEN the admin views the list
THEN the list should show all orders including:
  - ORD-10001 | John Doe | 2025-11-10 | Open | $59.98 | Completed | [View] [Edit]
  - ORD-10002 | Jane Smith | 2025-11-11 | Confirmed | $129.99 | Completed | [View] [Edit]

GIVEN the orders list is displayed
WHEN the admin views the page
THEN the page should provide filtering options:
  - Filter by Status (dropdown: All, Open, Confirmed, In Process, Shipped, Delivered)
  - Filter by Date Range (date pickers: From Date, To Date)
  - Filter by Customer Name (search box)
AND the page should provide sorting options:
  - Sort by Order ID (ascending/descending)
  - Sort by Order Date (ascending/descending)
  - Sort by Total Amount (ascending/descending)

GIVEN the admin wants to filter orders
WHEN the admin selects "Open" from the Status filter dropdown
AND the admin clicks "Apply Filter" or the filter applies automatically
THEN the list should update to show only orders with status "Open"
AND the list should display ORD-10001 and any other orders with "Open" status
AND other status orders should be hidden

GIVEN the admin wants to view all orders again
WHEN the admin selects "All" from the Status filter dropdown
THEN the list should display all orders regardless of status

GIVEN the admin is viewing the orders list
WHEN the admin needs to find a specific order
AND the admin enters "10003" in a search box (if available)
THEN the list should filter to show only ORD-10003
OR

THEN the admin should be able to locate order ORD-10003

GIVEN the admin wants to view details of a specific order
WHEN the admin clicks the "View" button for ORD-10003
THEN the system should navigate to the order details page (tested in TS-054)

GIVEN the admin is viewing the orders list
WHEN the admin checks the order count
THEN the page should display the total number of orders (e.g., "Showing 5 of 5 orders")
AND if there are many orders, the page should provide pagination

GIVEN there are more than 20 orders in the system
WHEN the admin views the orders list
THEN the page should display orders in pages (e.g., 20 per page)
AND the page should provide pagination controls (Previous, 1, 2, 3, Next)
