### 13.2 Defect Severity Classification

| Severity | Definition | Response Time | Examples |
|----------|------------|---------------|----------|
| Critical (S1) | System crash, data loss, security breach, payment failure | 4 hours | Payment processing fails, database corruption, security vulnerability |
| High (S2) | Major functionality broken, no workaround | 24 hours | Login broken, checkout non-functional, admin can't update orders |
| Medium (S3) | Functionality impaired but workaround exists | 48 hours | Filters not working correctly, email formatting issues |
| Low (S4) | Minor issue, cosmetic defect | 1 week | UI alignment issues, typos, minor visual glitches |

### 13.3 Defect Priority Classification

| Priority | Definition | When to Use |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| P1 - Immediate | Must fix before next test cycle | Critical business impact |
| P2 - High | Fix in current release | Significant user impact |
| P3 - Medium | Can be fixed in next release | Moderate user impact |
| P4 - Low | Fix if time permits | Minimal user impact |
