TEST SCRIPT: TS-030
Test Scenario: Select Saved Address
User Story: As a Buyer in Checkout, I want to select from my saved addresses, so that I can quickly complete checkout without re-entering information
Priority: High
Related Requirements: FR-008, FR-010

GIVEN the user is logged in
  AND the user has previously saved addresses in their account
  AND the user is on the checkout page (billing or shipping address step)

WHEN the checkout page loads

THEN the system should display a list of saved addresses
  AND each address should show:
    - Full name
    - Complete address
    - Phone number
    - An indicator if it's the default address
  AND provide an option to select an address
  AND provide an option to add a new address

WHEN the user selects a saved address

THEN the system should:
  - Populate all address fields with the selected address data
  - Validate the address for shipping (if shipping step)
  - Calculate shipping charges (if shipping step)
  - Allow the user to proceed to next step

WHEN the user selects "Add new address"

THEN the system should display empty address form
  AND allow the user to enter a new address

EXPECTED RESULT:
- All saved addresses are displayed correctly
- Address selection is simple and intuitive
- Selected address populates all required fields
- Default address is indicated clearly
- User can easily switch between saved and new addresses
- Validation occurs even with saved addresses
