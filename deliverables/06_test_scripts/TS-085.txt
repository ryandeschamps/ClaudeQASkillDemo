GIVEN the admin is logged into the admin panel
  AND a product exists with "Active" status
  AND the admin is viewing the product list or product details

WHEN the admin clicks "Deactivate" button for the active product

  - Change product status to "Inactive"
  - Update the product record
  - Display success confirmation message
  - Remove product from customer-facing pages

  - Prevent product from being added to new carts

WHEN the product is deactivated

THEN the product should NOT appear in:
  - Category/sub-category listings
  - Search results
  - Product browsing pages
  - New shopping carts

WHEN the product is already in a customer's cart

THEN the system should either:
  - Remove it from cart with notification
  - Keep it in cart but prevent checkout
  - Mark it as unavailable in cart

WHEN the product has active orders processing

THEN deactivation should not affect those orders
  AND orders should complete normally
