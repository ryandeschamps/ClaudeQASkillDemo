TEST SCRIPT: TS-062
Test Scenario: Edit Customer Profile
User Story: As a Logged-in Admin, I want to modify customer account information, so that I can correct errors or update details as needed
Priority: Medium
Related Requirements: FR-016

GIVEN the admin is logged into the admin panel
  AND the admin is viewing a customer's details page

WHEN the admin clicks "Edit" or "Edit Profile" button
  AND modifies customer information:
    - Name
    - Email address
    - Phone number
    - Address information
  AND saves the changes

THEN the system should:
  - Validate all required fields
  - Validate email format
  - Check email uniqueness (if email changed)
  - Validate phone number format
  - Update the customer record
  - Display success confirmation message
  - Send notification email to customer (optional)

WHEN the admin changes the email to one already in use

THEN the system should display error message
  AND not update the email

WHEN required fields are left empty

THEN the system should display validation errors
  AND prevent saving

WHEN the update is successful

THEN the customer details page should refresh with updated information
  AND changes should be reflected immediately

WHEN the admin modifies sensitive information

THEN the system should log the change for audit purposes

EXPECTED RESULT:
- Customer information can be edited successfully
- All validation rules are enforced
- Email uniqueness is maintained
- Changes are saved and persist
- Customer is notified of changes (if configured)
- Admin actions are logged
- Updated data is accurate across the system
