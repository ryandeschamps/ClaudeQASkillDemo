TEST SCRIPT: TS-068
Test Scenario: Update Order Status to Confirmed
User Story: As a Logged-in Admin, I want to change order status from Open to Confirmed, so that I can indicate payment verification
Priority: Critical
Related Requirements: FR-017

GIVEN the admin is logged into the admin panel
  AND an order exists with "Open" status
  AND the admin is viewing the order details page

WHEN the admin selects "Confirmed" from status dropdown
  OR clicks "Confirm Order" button
  AND saves the status change

THEN the system should:
  - Update order status to "Confirmed"
  - Record the status change timestamp
  - Log the admin user who made the change
  - Display success confirmation message
  - Send status update email to customer
  - Update order status in order list

WHEN the order status is updated to Confirmed

THEN the customer should receive email notification containing:
  - Order confirmation message
  - Order number and details
  - Estimated processing time
  - Next steps information

WHEN viewing order history/timeline

THEN the system should show:
  - Status change from "Open" to "Confirmed"
  - Timestamp of change
  - Admin who made the change

WHEN the order is already Confirmed or further along

THEN the system should either:
  - Not allow changing back to Open, OR
  - Require confirmation before allowing status reversal

EXPECTED RESULT:
- Order status updates successfully to Confirmed
- Customer receives notification email
- Status change is logged in order history
- Admin who made change is recorded
- Order appears in "Confirmed" filter
- Change is reflected immediately across system
- Order processing workflow can proceed
