TEST SCRIPT: TS-093
Test Scenario: Reject Product Review
User Story: As a Logged-in Admin, I want to reject an inappropriate review, so that I can maintain quality standards
Priority: Medium
Related Requirements: FR-020

GIVEN the admin is logged into the admin panel
  AND a review exists in "Pending" status
  AND the admin is viewing the pending reviews list or review details

WHEN the admin clicks "Reject" button for a specific review
  AND optionally provides a rejection reason
  AND confirms the rejection

THEN the system should:
  - Change review status to "Rejected"
  - Record rejection timestamp
  - Log the admin who rejected it
  - Record rejection reason (if provided)
  - Display success confirmation message
  - Remove review from pending list
  - Send notification to customer (optional)

WHEN the review is rejected

THEN the review should NOT:
  - Appear on product detail page
  - Be visible to any customers
  - Be included in product rating calculations

WHEN viewing rejected reviews

THEN the admin should be able to:
  - Access "Rejected" reviews list
  - See rejection date and reason
  - See which admin rejected it
  - Optionally reverse decision and approve

WHEN the customer is notified of rejection

THEN the notification should:
  - Inform them their review was not approved
  - Provide reason (if policy allows)
  - Explain review guidelines

WHEN bulk rejecting multiple reviews

THEN all selected reviews should be rejected
  AND confirmation should show count of rejected reviews

EXPECTED RESULT:
- Review rejection is successful
- Review status updates to "Rejected"
- Review is removed from public view
- Rejection is logged with admin and reason
- Customer may be notified (based on configuration)
- Rejected reviews are accessible in admin panel
- Decision can be reversed if needed
- Product ratings don't include rejected reviews
- Bulk rejection works correctly
