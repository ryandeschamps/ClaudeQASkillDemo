TEST SCRIPT: TS-020
Test Scenario: Update Cart Item Quantity
User Story: As a Logged-in Buyer, I want to change the quantity of items in my cart, so that I can adjust my order before purchase
Priority: High
Related Requirements: FR-007

GIVEN the user is logged in
  AND the user has items in their shopping cart
  AND the user is viewing the cart page

WHEN the user increases the quantity of an item (e.g., from 1 to 3)
  AND clicks "Update" or the quantity auto-updates

THEN the system should:
  - Update the item quantity in the cart
  - Recalculate the item subtotal
  - Recalculate the cart total
  - Display updated values

WHEN the user decreases the quantity to 0 or clicks remove

THEN the system should remove the item from the cart
  AND update the cart totals

WHEN the user tries to add quantity exceeding available stock

THEN the system should display an error message
  AND limit the quantity to maximum available stock
  AND not allow the update to exceed stock limits

EXPECTED RESULT:
- Quantity updates are reflected immediately
- Calculations update correctly with quantity changes
- Stock validation prevents over-ordering
- Removing items (quantity = 0) works properly
- Cart persists across sessions for logged-in users
- User interface is responsive and intuitive
