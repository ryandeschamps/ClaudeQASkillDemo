TEST SCRIPT: TS-073
Test Scenario: Edit Order Details
User Story: As a Logged-in Admin, I want to modify order information if needed, so that I can correct errors or accommodate customer requests
Priority: Medium
Related Requirements: FR-017

GIVEN the admin is logged into the admin panel
  AND an order exists in the system
  AND the admin is viewing the order details page

WHEN the admin clicks "Edit Order" button
  AND modifies order information such as:
    - Shipping address
    - Billing address
    - Contact phone number
    - Special instructions
  AND saves the changes

THEN the system should:
  - Validate all modified fields
  - Update the order record
  - Log the changes made with admin details and timestamp
  - Display success confirmation message
  - Send notification to customer if significant changes made

WHEN the admin attempts to modify critical order details after shipment

THEN the system should either:
  - Prevent modification of certain fields (like items, prices)
  - Display warning message
  - Require additional confirmation

WHEN the admin modifies the shipping address

THEN the system should:
  - Recalculate shipping charges if needed
  - Validate new address for shipping availability
  - Update the order total if shipping charges changed

WHEN required fields are left empty or invalid

THEN the system should display validation errors
  AND prevent saving until corrections are made

EXPECTED RESULT:
- Order details can be edited when appropriate
- Validation ensures data integrity
- Critical fields are protected once order progresses
- Changes are logged for audit trail
- Customer is notified of significant changes
- Shipping calculations update if address changes
- Admin can accommodate reasonable customer requests
- System prevents problematic modifications
