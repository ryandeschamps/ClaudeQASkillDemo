TEST SCRIPT: TS-029
Test Scenario: Use Same Address for Billing and Shipping
User Story: As a Buyer in Checkout, I want to use the same address for both billing and shipping, so that I can save time during checkout
Priority: High
Related Requirements: FR-008

GIVEN the user is logged in
  AND the user has completed the billing address step
  AND the user is on the shipping address step

WHEN the user checks the option "Same as billing address" or similar checkbox

THEN the system should:
  - Automatically populate all shipping address fields with billing address data
  - Disable manual editing of shipping address fields
  - Validate shipping availability to the billing address
  - Calculate shipping charges
  - Allow the user to proceed to next step

WHEN the user unchecks the "Same as billing address" option

THEN the system should:
  - Clear the shipping address fields
  - Enable manual editing of fields
  - Allow the user to enter a different shipping address

WHEN shipping is not available to the billing address

THEN the system should display an error message
  AND require the user to enter a different shipping address
  AND uncheck the "Same as billing address" option

EXPECTED RESULT:
- Checkbox option is clearly visible and functional
- Address data copies correctly from billing to shipping
- Fields are disabled when using same address
- Shipping validation still occurs
- User can easily switch between same/different addresses
- Saves time for users with matching addresses
