TEST SCRIPT: TS-104
Test Scenario: Create User Role
User Story: As a Logged-in Admin, I want to define new user roles with specific permissions, so that I can implement role-based access control
Priority: Medium
Related Requirements: FR-023

GIVEN the admin is logged into the admin panel
  AND the admin has permissions to manage roles

WHEN the admin navigates to "Role Management" or "Roles & Permissions" section
  AND clicks "Create New Role"
  AND enters role information:
    - Role name
    - Role description
    - Permission selections for different modules:
      * Dashboard access (View)
      * Product management (View, Create, Edit, Delete)
      * Category management (View, Create, Edit, Delete)
      * Order management (View, Update Status, Edit)
      * Customer management (View, Edit, Activate/Deactivate)
      * Reports (View, Export)
      * User management (View, Create, Edit, Delete)
      * Settings (View, Edit)
  AND saves the new role

THEN the system should:
  - Validate role name is unique
  - Validate required fields
  - Create the new role
  - Save all permission selections
  - Display success confirmation message
  - Make role available for user assignment

WHEN the role name already exists

THEN the system should display error message
  AND prevent creating duplicate role

WHEN no permissions are selected

THEN the system should either:
  - Warn that role has no permissions
  - Require at least one permission
  - Allow saving but role will have no access

WHEN the role is created

THEN it should:
  - Appear in role list
  - Be selectable when creating/editing sub-admins
  - Enforce defined permissions when assigned to users

EXPECTED RESULT:
- New role is created successfully
- Role name uniqueness is enforced
- All permission options are available
- Granular permissions can be set per module
- Role is immediately available for assignment
- Created role enforces defined access control
- Validation prevents invalid roles
- Interface clearly shows all permission options
