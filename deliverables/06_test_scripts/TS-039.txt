TEST SCRIPT: TS-039
Test Scenario: Track Order Shipment
User Story: As a Logged-in Buyer, I want to track my order's shipping status, so that I can know when to expect delivery
Priority: High
Related Requirements: FR-012

GIVEN the user is logged in
  AND the user has an order that has been shipped
  AND tracking information has been added by admin

WHEN the user views the order details page

THEN the system should display shipment tracking section with:
  - Shipping carrier name
  - Tracking number/ID
  - Shipment date
  - Expected delivery date
  - Current shipment status
  - Link to carrier's tracking page (if available)

WHEN the user clicks on the tracking number or tracking link

THEN the system should either:
  - Open carrier's tracking page in new window/tab, OR
  - Display tracking details within the application

WHEN the order has not yet been shipped

THEN the system should display current status (e.g., "Processing", "Confirmed")
  AND indicate that tracking will be available once shipped

WHEN the order has been delivered

THEN the system should display:
  - "Delivered" status
  - Delivery date and time
  - Recipient name (if provided by carrier)

EXPECTED RESULT:
- Tracking information is accurate and up-to-date
- Carrier tracking links work correctly
- Shipment status is clearly communicated
- Expected delivery date is shown
- Users can easily track their orders
- Updates reflect actual shipment progress
- Delivered orders show completion information
