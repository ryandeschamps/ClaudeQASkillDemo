TEST SCRIPT: TS-100
Test Scenario: Create Sub-Admin User
User Story: As a Logged-in Admin, I want to create new sub-admin users, so that I can delegate administrative tasks
Priority: Medium
Related Requirements: FR-022

GIVEN the admin is logged into the admin panel
  AND the admin has permissions to manage users

WHEN the admin navigates to "User Management" or "Sub-Admins" section
  AND clicks "Add New Sub-Admin" or "Create User"
  AND enters sub-admin information:
    - Full name
    - Email address
    - Username
    - Password
    - Role/Permission level
    - Department (optional)
    - Phone number (optional)
  AND saves the new sub-admin

THEN the system should:
  - Validate all required fields
  - Check email and username uniqueness
  - Validate password meets requirements
  - Create the sub-admin account
  - Assign selected role/permissions
  - Display success confirmation message
  - Send welcome email to sub-admin with login credentials

WHEN the email or username already exists

THEN the system should display error message
  AND prevent creating duplicate account

WHEN required fields are missing

THEN the system should display validation errors
  AND prevent saving until completed

WHEN password doesn't meet requirements

THEN the system should display password requirements
  AND prevent saving until valid password is entered

WHEN the sub-admin account is created

THEN the sub-admin should be able to:
  - Log into the admin panel with provided credentials
  - Access features based on assigned role
  - Perform tasks within their permission level

EXPECTED RESULT:
- Sub-admin account is created successfully
- Email and username uniqueness is enforced
- Password requirements are validated
- Role/permissions are assigned correctly
- Welcome email is sent with credentials
- Sub-admin can log in immediately
- Access is limited to assigned permissions
- Validation prevents invalid data
