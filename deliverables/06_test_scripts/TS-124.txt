TEST SCRIPT: TS-124
Test Scenario: Validate Shipping PIN Code
User Story: As a System, I want to verify if shipping is available to entered PIN code, so that I can set accurate customer expectations
Priority: High
Related Requirements: FR-005

GIVEN the system has shipping availability data configured
  AND serviceable and non-serviceable PIN codes are defined

WHEN a visitor enters a PIN code on product page
  AND clicks "Check Availability"

THEN the system should:
  - Validate PIN code format (numeric, correct length)
  - Check against serviceable PIN codes database
  - Display availability status

WHEN the PIN code is serviceable

THEN the system should display:
  - "Delivery available to this location"
  - Estimated delivery date
  - Shipping charges (if calculable)
  - Delivery timeframe (e.g., "3-5 business days")

WHEN the PIN code is not serviceable

THEN the system should display:
  - "Delivery not available to this location"
  - Clear message explaining non-availability
  - Option to check different PIN code

WHEN the PIN code format is invalid

THEN the system should display:
  - "Please enter a valid PIN code"
  - Format requirements (e.g., "6 digits")
  - Allow re-entry

WHEN customer proceeds to checkout with non-serviceable PIN

THEN the system should:
  - Validate shipping address PIN code
  - Display error if not serviceable
  - Prevent order completion
  - Require serviceable shipping address

WHEN customer enters serviceable PIN during checkout

THEN the system should:
  - Accept the address
  - Calculate accurate shipping charges
  - Provide delivery estimate
  - Allow order completion

WHEN shipping data is not available for a PIN code

THEN the system should:
  - Display "Unable to check availability" message
  - Allow customer to proceed but warn
  - Or require manual verification

EXPECTED RESULT:
- PIN code validation works correctly
- Format validation prevents invalid entries
- Availability check is accurate based on data
- Serviceable PINs allow order completion
- Non-serviceable PINs prevent order completion
- Error messages are clear and helpful
- Delivery estimates are provided when available
- Shipping charges are calculated correctly
- Customer expectations are set accurately
- System prevents undeliverable orders
