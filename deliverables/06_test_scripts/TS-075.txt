TEST SCRIPT: TS-075
Test Scenario: Create New Category
User Story: As a Logged-in Admin, I want to add a new product category, so that I can expand product organization
Priority: High
Related Requirements: FR-018

GIVEN the admin is logged into the admin panel
  AND the admin is on the category management page

WHEN the admin clicks "Add New Category" or "Create Category" button
  AND enters category information:
    - Category name
    - Category description
    - Display order/priority (optional)
    - Status (Active/Inactive)
    - Category image/icon (optional)
  AND saves the new category

THEN the system should:
  - Validate all required fields are completed
  - Check that category name is unique
  - Create the new category
  - Display success confirmation message
  - Add category to the category list
  - Make category available for product assignment

WHEN the category name already exists

THEN the system should display error message
  AND prevent creating duplicate category
  AND prompt for a unique name

WHEN required fields are missing

THEN the system should display validation errors
  AND prevent saving until all required fields are completed

WHEN the category is created as Active

THEN it should immediately appear in:
  - Admin category list
  - Product assignment dropdowns
  - Customer-facing category navigation (if configured to show)

EXPECTED RESULT:
- New category is created successfully
- Category name uniqueness is enforced
- All category information is saved correctly
- Category appears in category list immediately
- Can be used for product assignment right away
- Validation prevents invalid data
- Success confirmation is clear
- Category hierarchy can be maintained
