TEST SCRIPT: TS-063
Test Scenario: Activate Customer Account
User Story: As a Logged-in Admin, I want to activate an inactive customer account, so that I can restore access for legitimate users
Priority: Medium
Related Requirements: FR-016

GIVEN the admin is logged into the admin panel
  AND a customer account exists with "Inactive" status
  AND the admin is viewing the customer details or customer list

WHEN the admin clicks "Activate" button for the inactive account
  AND confirms the action (if confirmation required)

THEN the system should:
  - Change the account status to "Active"
  - Update the customer record in database
  - Display success confirmation message
  - Send notification email to customer (optional)
  - Log the activation action with admin details and timestamp

WHEN the account is activated

THEN the customer should be able to:
  - Log in to their account
  - Access all account features
  - Place orders
  - Access their previous order history and data

WHEN viewing the customer list

THEN the activated account should now appear in "Active" filter
  AND status should display as "Active"

WHEN the admin activates an already active account

THEN the system should either:
  - Display message "Account is already active", OR
  - Not show activate option for active accounts

EXPECTED RESULT:
- Account activation is successful
- Customer can immediately access their account
- Status change is reflected throughout the system
- Customer receives notification (if configured)
- Admin action is logged for audit trail
- All customer data and history is preserved
- Process is quick and straightforward
