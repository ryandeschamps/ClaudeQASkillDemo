TEST SCRIPT: TS-078
Test Scenario: Activate/Deactivate Category
User Story: As a Logged-in Admin, I want to change category status, so that I can control which categories are visible to customers
Priority: Medium
Related Requirements: FR-018

GIVEN the admin is logged into the admin panel
  AND a category exists in the system
  AND the admin is on the category management page

WHEN the admin clicks "Deactivate" for an Active category
  AND confirms the action

THEN the system should:
  - Change category status to "Inactive"
  - Display success confirmation message
  - Remove category from customer-facing navigation
  - Keep category in admin list (marked as Inactive)
  - Optionally hide products in this category from customer view

WHEN the admin clicks "Activate" for an Inactive category
  AND confirms the action

THEN the system should:
  - Change category status to "Active"
  - Display success confirmation message
  - Add category to customer-facing navigation
  - Make category visible to customers
  - Show products in this category to customers

WHEN deactivating a category that has sub-categories

THEN the system should either:
  - Also deactivate all sub-categories, OR
  - Warn admin and ask for confirmation
  - Handle sub-category visibility appropriately

WHEN deactivating a category with products assigned

THEN the system should:
  - Warn admin that products will be affected
  - Keep product assignments but hide from customer view
  - Not delete products or assignments

EXPECTED RESULT:
- Category status changes successfully
- Active categories appear in customer navigation
- Inactive categories are hidden from customers
- Status change is immediate
- Products are handled appropriately
- Sub-categories follow parent status (if configured)
- Admin can easily toggle category visibility
- Changes are reversible
