GIVEN the user is logged in
  AND the user has reviewed the order summary
  AND the user is on the payment page
  AND net banking payment option is configured

WHEN the user selects "Net Banking" as payment method
  AND selects their bank from the list of available banks
  AND clicks "Proceed to Pay"

THEN the system should:
  - Redirect to the selected bank's internet banking page
  - Pass transaction details to the bank
  - Display processing indicator

WHEN the user completes authentication and payment on bank's site

THEN the bank should redirect back to the ecommerce site
  AND the system should:
    - Verify payment status
    - Create order upon successful payment
    - Display order confirmation page
    - Send order confirmation email

WHEN the user cancels payment on bank's site
