Test Scenario: Manage Address Book
User Story: As a Logged-in Buyer, I want to add, edit, and delete saved addresses, so that I can maintain up-to-date delivery locations
Priority: High

GIVEN the user is logged in
  AND the user is on the address book page

WHEN the user clicks "Add New Address"
  AND enters address details
  AND saves the address

THEN the system should:
  - Validate all required fields
  - Save the new address
  - Display it in the address book
  - Show success confirmation

WHEN the user clicks "Edit" on an existing address
  AND modifies the details
  AND saves changes

THEN the system should:
  - Update the address
  - Display success confirmation
  - Show updated address in address book

WHEN the user clicks "Delete" on an address
  AND confirms the deletion

THEN the system should:
  - Remove the address from address book
  - Display confirmation message
  - Update the address list

WHEN the user tries to delete the only/last address

THEN the system should either:
  - Allow deletion (addresses are optional), OR
  - Prevent deletion and require at least one address

  AND show which is default for billing/shipping

EXPECTED RESULT:
- Add, edit, delete operations work correctly
- Address validation is thorough
