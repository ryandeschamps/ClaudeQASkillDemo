TEST SCRIPT: TS-081
Test Scenario: Upload Product Images
User Story: As a Logged-in Admin, I want to upload multiple images for a product, so that I can showcase the product visually
Priority: High
Related Requirements: FR-019

GIVEN the admin is logged into the admin panel
  AND the admin is creating a new product OR editing an existing product

WHEN the admin clicks on image upload area
  AND selects one or multiple image files
  AND uploads the images

THEN the system should:
  - Validate image file types (e.g., JPG, PNG, GIF)
  - Validate file sizes (within allowed limits)
  - Upload and save the images
  - Generate thumbnails if needed
  - Display uploaded images as preview
  - Allow setting one image as primary/main image

WHEN the admin uploads multiple images

THEN the system should:
  - Accept all valid images
  - Allow reordering images (drag and drop or numbered order)
  - Show all images in the product gallery
  - Designate first image as default primary (or allow manual selection)

WHEN an uploaded file is not a valid image format

THEN the system should display error message
  AND not upload the invalid file
  AND allow uploading other valid files

WHEN an image file exceeds size limit

THEN the system should display error message indicating file size limit
  AND not upload the oversized file

WHEN the admin wants to delete an uploaded image

THEN the system should:
  - Provide delete option for each image
  - Confirm deletion
  - Remove image from product

EXPECTED RESULT:
- Multiple images can be uploaded successfully
- File type validation works correctly
- File size validation prevents oversized uploads
- Images display as previews after upload
- Primary image can be designated
- Image order can be managed
- Delete functionality works
- Images appear on product detail page in correct order
- Image quality is maintained
