TEST SCRIPT: TS-086
Test Scenario: Delete Product
User Story: As a Logged-in Admin, I want to delete a product from the catalog, so that I can remove discontinued items
Priority: Medium
Related Requirements: FR-019

GIVEN the admin is logged into the admin panel
  AND a product exists in the catalog
  AND the admin is viewing the product list or product details

WHEN the admin clicks "Delete" button for a product
  AND confirms the deletion action

THEN the system should:
  - Verify the product can be safely deleted
  - Remove the product from the catalog
  - Display success confirmation message
  - Remove product from all listings

WHEN the product has associated orders (past purchases)

THEN the system should either:
  - Prevent deletion and display warning message
  - Suggest deactivating instead of deleting
  - Allow soft delete (mark as deleted but preserve for order history)

WHEN the product is in active shopping carts

THEN the system should:
  - Warn admin before deletion
  - Remove product from all carts upon deletion
  - Notify customers (optional)

WHEN the product has reviews

THEN the system should either:
  - Delete reviews with the product
  - Archive reviews
  - Prevent deletion if reviews exist

WHEN the product is successfully deleted

THEN the system should:
  - Remove product from category listings
  - Remove from search index
  - Remove from all customer-facing pages
  - Remove from admin product list
  - Optionally archive product data for records

WHEN the admin attempts to delete a product with order history

THEN the system should recommend deactivation instead
  AND preserve product data for order integrity

EXPECTED RESULT:
- Product deletion works for eligible products
- System prevents problematic deletions
- Orders with deleted products maintain their integrity
- Deletion is irreversible (or soft-deleted)
- Related data is handled appropriately
- Admin receives clear warnings before deletion
- Deactivation is suggested as safer alternative
- Data integrity is maintained
