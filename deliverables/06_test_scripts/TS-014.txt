TEST SCRIPT: TS-014
Test Scenario: Login with Facebook Account
User Story: As a Visitor/Buyer, I want to log in using my Facebook account, so that I can access the site quickly without remembering separate credentials
Priority: High
Related Requirements: FR-001

GIVEN the user is on the login page
  AND Facebook OAuth integration is configured
  AND the user has a valid Facebook account

WHEN the user clicks the "Login with Facebook" button

THEN the system should redirect to Facebook authentication page
  AND prompt the user to authorize the application

WHEN the user authorizes the application

THEN the system should:
  - Receive authentication token from Facebook
  - Create a new account if the user is logging in for the first time
  - Link to existing account if the email matches
  - Log the user into the application
  - Redirect to the homepage or previous page

WHEN the user cancels the Facebook authentication

THEN the system should return to the login page
  AND display no error (cancelled by user)

EXPECTED RESULT:
- Facebook login button is visible and functional
- OAuth flow completes successfully
- New users are registered automatically with Facebook profile data
- Existing users can link Facebook to their account
- Session is created upon successful authentication
- User is redirected appropriately after login
- Security: OAuth tokens are handled securely
