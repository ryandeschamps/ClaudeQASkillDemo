Test Scenario: Update Order Status to In Process
User Story: As a Logged-in Admin, I want to change order status to In Process, so that I can indicate order preparation has started
Priority: Critical
Related Requirements: FR-017

GIVEN the admin is logged into the admin panel
  AND an order exists with "Confirmed" status
  AND the admin is viewing the order details page

WHEN the admin selects "In Process" from status dropdown

THEN the system should:
  - Update order status to "In Process"
  - Record the status change timestamp
  - Log the admin user who made the change
  - Display success confirmation message
  - Send status update email to customer
  - Update order status in order list

WHEN the order status is updated to In Process

THEN the customer should receive email notification containing:
  - Order is being prepared message
  - Order number
  - Expected shipment timeframe

WHEN viewing order history/timeline

THEN the system should show:
  - Status change to "In Process"
  - Timestamp of change
  - Admin who made the change

WHEN attempting to change from other statuses to In Process

THEN the system should validate proper status flow
  AND allow or prevent based on business rules

EXPECTED RESULT:

- Status change is logged in order history
- Admin who made change is recorded
- Order appears in "In Process" filter
- Change is reflected immediately across system
- Indicates fulfillment team is working on order
