TEST SCRIPT: TS-074
Test Scenario: View Product Categories
User Story: As a Logged-in Admin, I want to see all product categories and sub-categories, so that I can manage the product classification structure
Priority: High

GIVEN the admin is logged into the admin panel

WHEN the admin navigates to "Category Management" or "Categories" section

THEN the system should display all product categories in a hierarchical view showing:
  - Category name
  - Parent category (for sub-categories)
  - Number of products in category
  - Status (Active/Inactive)
  - Created date
  - Actions (Edit, Activate/Deactivate, Delete, Add Sub-category)

WHEN categories have sub-categories

THEN the system should display them in a tree structure
  OR with clear parent-child relationship indication
  AND allow expanding/collapsing category groups

WHEN the admin clicks on a category

THEN the system should either:
  - Show category details and settings, OR
  - Expand to show sub-categories
  - Display list of products in that category

WHEN viewing the category list

THEN inactive categories should be clearly distinguished
  AND the hierarchy should be easy to understand
  AND navigation should be intuitive

WHEN there are many categories

THEN the system should provide:
  - Search functionality
  - Filter by status (Active/Inactive)
  - Sort options

EXPECTED RESULT:
- All categories and sub-categories are displayed
- Hierarchical structure is clear and intuitive
