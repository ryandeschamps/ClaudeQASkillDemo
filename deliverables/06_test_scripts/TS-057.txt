TEST SCRIPT: TS-057
Test Scenario: View Total Registered Buyers
User Story: As a Logged-in Admin, I want to see the count of active and inactive registered buyers, so that I can monitor customer base growth
Priority: Medium
Related Requirements: FR-015

GIVEN the admin is logged into the admin panel
  AND the admin is viewing the dashboard

WHEN the dashboard displays registered buyers metric

THEN the system should show:
  - Total number of registered buyers
  - Number of active buyers
  - Number of inactive buyers
  - Growth trend (optional - e.g., +5% from last month)

WHEN the admin clicks on the registered buyers metric

THEN the system should navigate to the customer management page
  AND display the full list of buyers with filter options

WHEN viewing the buyer statistics

THEN the counts should be:
  - Accurate based on current database records
  - Broken down by status (active/inactive)
  - Updated in real-time or near real-time

WHEN a new buyer registers

THEN the total count should increment
  AND the active count should increase by 1

WHEN an admin deactivates a buyer account

THEN the active count should decrease
  AND inactive count should increase
  AND total remains the same

EXPECTED RESULT:
- Buyer counts are accurate
- Active/inactive breakdown is correct
- Statistics update when buyer data changes
- Clicking metric navigates to customer list
- Growth trends are calculated correctly (if included)
- Display is clear and informative
- Data helps admin track customer base growth
