TEST SCRIPT: TS-101
Test Scenario: Edit Sub-Admin User
User Story: As a Logged-in Admin, I want to modify sub-admin user details, so that I can update their information
Priority: Medium
Related Requirements: FR-022

GIVEN the admin is logged into the admin panel
  AND sub-admin users exist in the system
  AND the admin is viewing the user management page

WHEN the admin clicks "Edit" for a specific sub-admin
  AND modifies user information:
    - Full name
    - Email address
    - Phone number
    - Department
    - Role/Permission level
  AND saves the changes

THEN the system should:
  - Validate all required fields
  - Check email uniqueness if changed
  - Update the sub-admin record
  - Update role/permissions if changed
  - Display success confirmation message
  - Send notification to sub-admin if significant changes made

WHEN the email is changed to one already in use

THEN the system should display error message
  AND not update the email

WHEN the role/permission level is changed

THEN the system should:
  - Update the permissions immediately
  - Apply new access restrictions
  - Log out sub-admin if currently logged in (optional)
  - Notify sub-admin of permission changes

WHEN required fields are left empty

THEN the system should display validation errors
  AND prevent saving

WHEN the admin wants to reset sub-admin's password

THEN the system should provide option to:
  - Send password reset email
  - Manually set new password
  - Require password change on next login

EXPECTED RESULT:
- Sub-admin information updates successfully
- Email uniqueness is enforced
- Role/permission changes take effect immediately
- Sub-admin is notified of significant changes
- Validation prevents invalid updates
- Password reset options are available
- Changes are logged for audit trail
- Updated permissions are enforced
