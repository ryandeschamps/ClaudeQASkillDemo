TEST SCRIPT: TS-047
Test Scenario: Set Default Shipping Address
User Story: As a Logged-in Buyer, I want to designate a default shipping address, so that I can speed up the checkout process
Priority: Medium
Related Requirements: FR-010

GIVEN the user is logged in
  AND the user has multiple addresses saved in their address book
  AND the user is viewing the address book page

WHEN the user selects an address
  AND clicks "Set as Default Shipping Address" or similar option

THEN the system should:
  - Mark the selected address as default shipping address
  - Remove default shipping flag from any previously default address
  - Display visual indicator (e.g., badge, star) on the default address
  - Show success confirmation message

WHEN the user is at checkout shipping address step

THEN the system should:
  - Automatically pre-select the default shipping address
  - Pre-populate shipping fields with default address
  - Calculate shipping charges for default address
  - Allow user to change if desired

WHEN only one address exists

THEN the system should automatically use it as default
  AND indicate it as the default address

WHEN the same address is set as both default billing and shipping

THEN the system should allow this
  AND display both indicators on the address

EXPECTED RESULT:
- Default shipping address is set successfully
- Only one address can be default shipping at a time
- Visual indicators clearly show default status
- Checkout pre-populates with default shipping address
- User can have different default billing and shipping addresses
- User can change default at any time
- Changes persist across sessions
