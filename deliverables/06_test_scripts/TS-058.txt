TEST SCRIPT: TS-058
Test Scenario: View Total Products Count
User Story: As a Logged-in Admin, I want to see the total number of products in the catalog, so that I can monitor inventory size
Priority: Medium
Related Requirements: FR-015

GIVEN the admin is logged into the admin panel
  AND the admin is viewing the dashboard

WHEN the dashboard displays product metrics

THEN the system should show:
  - Total number of products in catalog
  - Number of active products
  - Number of inactive products
  - Optional: Number of out-of-stock products
  - Optional: Number of products added this month

WHEN the admin clicks on the products metric

THEN the system should navigate to the product management page
  AND display the full product catalog

WHEN viewing product statistics

THEN the counts should:
  - Be accurate based on current product database
  - Include breakdown by status (active/inactive)
  - Reflect real-time or near real-time data

WHEN a new product is added

THEN the total product count should increment immediately

WHEN a product is deleted

THEN the total product count should decrement

WHEN a product is activated or deactivated

THEN the active/inactive counts should update accordingly

EXPECTED RESULT:
- Product counts are accurate
- Active/inactive breakdown is correct
- Statistics update when product data changes
- Clicking metric navigates to product catalog
- Out-of-stock alerts are visible (if implemented)
- Display helps admin monitor catalog size
- Real-time or near real-time updates
