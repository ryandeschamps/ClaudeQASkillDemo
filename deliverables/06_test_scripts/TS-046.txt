TEST SCRIPT: TS-046
Test Scenario: Set Default Billing Address
User Story: As a Logged-in Buyer, I want to designate a default billing address, so that I can speed up the checkout process
Priority: Medium
Related Requirements: FR-010

GIVEN the user is logged in
  AND the user has multiple addresses saved in their address book
  AND the user is viewing the address book page

WHEN the user selects an address
  AND clicks "Set as Default Billing Address" or similar option

THEN the system should:
  - Mark the selected address as default billing address
  - Remove default billing flag from any previously default address
  - Display visual indicator (e.g., badge, star) on the default address
  - Show success confirmation message

WHEN the user is at checkout billing address step

THEN the system should:
  - Automatically pre-select the default billing address
  - Pre-populate billing fields with default address
  - Allow user to change if desired

WHEN only one address exists

THEN the system should automatically use it as default
  AND indicate it as the default address

EXPECTED RESULT:
- Default billing address is set successfully
- Only one address can be default billing at a time
- Visual indicators clearly show default status
- Checkout pre-populates with default billing address
- User can change default at any time
- Changes persist across sessions
- Setting default is quick and intuitive
