TEST SCRIPT: TS-076
Test Scenario: Create New Sub-Category
User Story: As a Logged-in Admin, I want to add a sub-category under an existing category, so that I can create more specific product classifications
Priority: High
Related Requirements: FR-018

GIVEN the admin is logged into the admin panel
  AND at least one parent category exists
  AND the admin is on the category management page

WHEN the admin clicks "Add Sub-Category" for a parent category
  OR selects parent category while creating new category
  AND enters sub-category information:
    - Sub-category name
    - Parent category selection
    - Description
    - Display order (optional)
    - Status (Active/Inactive)
  AND saves the sub-category

THEN the system should:
  - Validate all required fields
  - Check that sub-category name is unique within parent
  - Create the new sub-category
  - Link it to the parent category
  - Display success confirmation message
  - Show sub-category under parent in category list

WHEN the sub-category name already exists under same parent

THEN the system should display error message
  AND prevent creating duplicate

WHEN parent category is not selected

THEN the system should display validation error
  AND require parent category selection

WHEN the sub-category is created as Active
  AND parent category is Active

THEN the sub-category should appear in:
  - Category hierarchy under parent
  - Product assignment options
  - Customer-facing navigation under parent category

WHEN parent category is Inactive

THEN the sub-category should also be treated as Inactive
  OR system should warn admin about parent status

EXPECTED RESULT:
- Sub-category is created successfully
- Parent-child relationship is established correctly
- Sub-category appears under parent in hierarchy
- Name uniqueness is enforced within parent
- Can be used for product assignment
- Validation works properly
- Hierarchy is maintained correctly
- Customer navigation reflects structure
