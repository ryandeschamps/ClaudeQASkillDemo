TEST SCRIPT: TS-107
Test Scenario: Activate/Deactivate Role
User Story: As a Logged-in Admin, I want to activate or deactivate user roles, so that I can manage available permission sets
Priority: Low
Related Requirements: FR-023

GIVEN the admin is logged into the admin panel
  AND user roles exist in the system
  AND the admin is viewing the role management page

WHEN the admin clicks "Deactivate" for an active role
  AND confirms the action

THEN the system should:
  - Change role status to "Inactive"
  - Remove role from role selection dropdowns
  - Display success confirmation message
  - Warn if users are currently assigned to this role

WHEN users are assigned to the deactivated role

THEN the system should either:
  - Prevent deactivation until users are reassigned
  - Keep existing users with the role but prevent new assignments
  - Provide option to reassign users during deactivation

WHEN the admin clicks "Activate" for an inactive role
  AND confirms the action

THEN the system should:
  - Change role status to "Active"
  - Make role available in role selection dropdowns
  - Display success confirmation message
  - Allow assigning role to users

WHEN viewing the role list

THEN inactive roles should be:
  - Clearly marked with "Inactive" status
  - Distinguishable from active roles
  - Filterable by status

WHEN creating or editing a sub-admin

THEN only active roles should appear in the role dropdown

WHEN a deactivated role is reactivated

THEN it should be immediately available for assignment

EXPECTED RESULT:
- Role deactivation prevents new assignments
- Existing assignments are handled appropriately
- Role activation makes it available again
- Status is clearly indicated in role list
- Active/inactive filter works correctly
- Deactivation doesn't break existing user access
- Admin has flexibility in managing role availability
- Changes take effect immediately
