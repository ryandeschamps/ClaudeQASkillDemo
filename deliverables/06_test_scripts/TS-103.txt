TEST SCRIPT: TS-103
Test Scenario: Delete Sub-Admin User
User Story: As a Logged-in Admin, I want to remove sub-admin users, so that I can revoke access for former staff
Priority: Medium
Related Requirements: FR-022

GIVEN the admin is logged into the admin panel
  AND sub-admin users exist in the system
  AND the admin is viewing the user management page

WHEN the admin clicks "Delete" for a specific sub-admin
  AND confirms the deletion action

THEN the system should:
  - Verify the sub-admin can be safely deleted
  - Prompt for confirmation with warning
  - Terminate any active sessions
  - Remove the sub-admin account
  - Display success confirmation message
  - Log the deletion with admin details

WHEN the sub-admin has activity logs or audit trail

THEN the system should either:
  - Soft delete (mark as deleted but preserve data)
  - Archive the account and associated logs
  - Maintain audit trail integrity

WHEN the deleted sub-admin has created/modified records

THEN the system should:
  - Preserve those records
  - Keep audit trail of who created/modified them
  - Not delete historical data

WHEN the deleted sub-admin tries to log in

THEN the system should:
  - Deny login
  - Display "Account not found" or similar message

WHEN attempting to delete the primary/main admin account

THEN the system should:
  - Prevent deletion
  - Display error message
  - Maintain at least one admin account

WHEN viewing the sub-admin list after deletion

THEN the deleted account should:
  - Not appear in active users list
  - Optionally appear in archived/deleted users list
  - Not be recoverable (or require special process)

EXPECTED RESULT:
- Sub-admin deletion works for eligible accounts
- Primary admin cannot be deleted
- Deletion is confirmed before execution
- Active sessions are terminated
- Account is removed from system
- Audit trails and historical data are preserved
- Former sub-admin cannot access system
- Deletion is logged for accountability
- Data integrity is maintained
