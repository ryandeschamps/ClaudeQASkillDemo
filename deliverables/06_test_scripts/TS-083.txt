User Story: As a Logged-in Admin, I want to define available sizes and colors for a product, so that I can offer customers multiple options
Priority: High
Related Requirements: FR-019

GIVEN the admin is logged into the admin panel
  AND the admin is creating or editing a product

WHEN the admin adds product size variations:
  - Selects available sizes (e.g., XS, S, M, L, XL, XXL)
  - Sets stock quantity for each size
  - Sets price adjustment for each size (if applicable)

THEN the system should:
  - Save all size variations
  - Associate stock levels with each size
  - Apply price adjustments if configured

WHEN the admin adds product color variations:
  - Selects or adds available colors
  - Uploads color-specific images (optional)
  - Sets stock quantity for each color
  - Sets SKU for each color variant (optional)

THEN the system should:
  - Save all color variations
  - Associate images with colors if provided
  - Track stock separately for each color

WHEN the admin sets up size AND color combinations:
  - Defines which size-color combinations are available
  - Sets stock quantity for each combination
  - Sets specific SKU for each variant

THEN the system should:
  - Create a variation matrix
  - Track stock for each unique combination
  - Allow or prevent customer selection based on availability

WHEN a variation is out of stock

THEN the system should:
  - Mark that variation as unavailable on customer-facing pages
  - Disable selection or gray out the option
  - Update availability when stock is replenished

EXPECTED RESULT:
- All size variations are saved correctly
- All color variations are saved correctly
- Size-color combinations work properly
- Stock is tracked per variation
- Customer can only select available combinations
- Out of stock variations are clearly indicated
- Images update based on color selection
- Variation data is accurate and complete
- Price adjustments apply correctly
