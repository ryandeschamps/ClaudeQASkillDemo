Test Scenario: Contact Support as Guest
User Story: As a Visitor, I want to contact customer support without having an account, so that I can get answers to pre-purchase questions
Priority: Medium
Related Requirements: FR-013

GIVEN the user is on the ecommerce website
  AND the user is not logged in
  AND a contact support page or form is available

WHEN the user navigates to the Contact Us page
  AND fills in the required fields:
    - Name
    - Email address
    - Subject
    - Message
  AND submits the form

THEN the system should validate all required fields
  AND display a success confirmation message
  AND send the inquiry to customer support
