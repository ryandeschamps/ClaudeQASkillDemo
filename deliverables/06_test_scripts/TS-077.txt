TEST SCRIPT: TS-077
Test Scenario: Edit Category
User Story: As a Logged-in Admin, I want to modify category details, so that I can update category information
Priority: Medium
Related Requirements: FR-018

GIVEN the admin is logged into the admin panel
  AND a category exists in the system
  AND the admin is on the category management page

WHEN the admin clicks "Edit" for a specific category
  AND modifies category information:
    - Category name
    - Description
    - Display order
    - Parent category (for sub-categories)
    - Category image
  AND saves the changes

THEN the system should:
  - Validate all required fields
  - Check name uniqueness if name was changed
  - Update the category record
  - Display success confirmation message
  - Reflect changes immediately in category list
  - Update category display on customer-facing site

WHEN the admin changes a category name to one that already exists

THEN the system should display error message
  AND not update the category name

WHEN the admin changes parent category for a sub-category

THEN the system should:
  - Move the sub-category to new parent
  - Update category hierarchy
  - Warn if this affects existing products

WHEN required fields are left empty

THEN the system should display validation errors
  AND prevent saving

WHEN the category has products assigned

THEN changes should reflect in product categorization
  AND customer should see products under updated category info

EXPECTED RESULT:
- Category information updates successfully
- Name uniqueness is enforced
- Changes are reflected throughout system
- Product assignments are maintained
- Category hierarchy is updated if parent changed
- Customer-facing display updates accordingly
- Validation prevents invalid changes
- Admin sees immediate confirmation
