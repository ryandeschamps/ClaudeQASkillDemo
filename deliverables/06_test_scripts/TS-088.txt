TEST SCRIPT: TS-088
Test Scenario: View Payment Information
User Story: As a Logged-in Admin, I want to view configured payment account details, so that I can verify payment setup
Priority: High
Related Requirements: FR-020

GIVEN the admin is logged into the admin panel
  AND payment account information has been configured

WHEN the admin navigates to "Payment Settings" or "Payment Information" section

THEN the system should display:
  - Payment gateway provider (e.g., Stripe)
  - Connected bank account details (masked/secure display)
  - Account holder name
  - Bank name
  - Account number (partially masked)
  - Routing/IFSC code (partially masked)
  - Account status (Active/Inactive)
  - Integration status (Connected/Disconnected)
  - Last transaction date (if available)
  - Supported payment methods (Credit Card, Debit Card, Net Banking)

WHEN viewing sensitive information

THEN the system should:
  - Mask sensitive data (show only last 4 digits of account number)
  - Display in secure, read-only format
  - Not expose full account credentials

WHEN payment gateway is not configured

THEN the system should:
  - Display message indicating setup is required
  - Provide link/button to configure payment settings
  - Show setup instructions

  AND show successful integration indicator

EXPECTED RESULT:
- Payment account information is displayed correctly

- Integration status is clear
- Admin can verify payment setup
- All configured payment methods are shown
- Display is organized and informative
- Security best practices are followed
