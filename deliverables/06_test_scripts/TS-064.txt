TEST SCRIPT: TS-064
Test Scenario: Deactivate Customer Account
User Story: As a Logged-in Admin, I want to deactivate a customer account, so that I can prevent access for problematic users
Priority: Medium
Related Requirements: FR-016

GIVEN the admin is logged into the admin panel
  AND a customer account exists with "Active" status
  AND the admin is viewing the customer details or customer list

WHEN the admin clicks "Deactivate" button for the active account
  AND provides reason for deactivation (optional)
  AND confirms the action

THEN the system should:
  - Change the account status to "Inactive"
  - Update the customer record in database
  - Terminate any active sessions for that customer
  - Display success confirmation message
  - Send notification email to customer (optional)
  - Log the deactivation with admin details, timestamp, and reason

WHEN the account is deactivated

THEN the customer should NOT be able to:
  - Log in to their account
  - Place new orders
  - Access account features

WHEN a deactivated customer tries to log in

THEN the system should display error message
  AND indicate account is deactivated
  AND provide customer support contact information

WHEN viewing the customer list

THEN the deactivated account should appear in "Inactive" filter
  AND status should display as "Inactive"

WHEN the admin deactivates an already inactive account

THEN the system should either:
  - Display message "Account is already inactive", OR
  - Not show deactivate option for inactive accounts

EXPECTED RESULT:
- Account deactivation is successful
- Customer is immediately logged out and cannot log back in
- Status change is reflected throughout system
- Customer data and history are preserved (not deleted)
- Admin action is logged with reason
- Customer receives notification (if configured)
- Deactivation can be reversed by reactivating
