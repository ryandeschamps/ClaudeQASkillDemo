TEST SCRIPT: TS-114
Test Scenario: Delete Email Content
User Story: As a Logged-in Admin, I want to remove outdated email content, so that I can maintain relevant messaging
Priority: Low
Related Requirements: FR-025

GIVEN the admin is logged into the admin panel
  AND email campaigns or drafts exist in the system

WHEN the admin navigates to "Email Management" section
  AND views list of email campaigns
  AND clicks "Delete" for a specific campaign
  AND confirms the deletion

THEN the system should:
  - Verify the campaign can be deleted
  - Warn if campaign is scheduled
  - Remove the email campaign
  - Display success confirmation message
  - Remove from campaigns list

WHEN attempting to delete a campaign that has already been sent

THEN the system should either:
  - Prevent deletion (preserve for records)
  - Allow archiving instead of deletion
  - Soft delete (hide but maintain records)
  - Warn about deleting sent campaigns

WHEN deleting a draft campaign

THEN the system should:
  - Allow deletion without restrictions
  - Confirm deletion
  - Permanently remove the draft

WHEN deleting a scheduled campaign

THEN the system should:
  - Warn that campaign is scheduled to send
  - Confirm admin wants to cancel and delete
  - Cancel scheduled sending
  - Delete the campaign

WHEN viewing sent email history

THEN sent campaigns should:
  - Not be easily deletable
  - Be archived or marked as sent
  - Preserve analytics and delivery data

WHEN the admin wants to remove old campaigns

THEN the system should provide:
  - Bulk delete option for drafts
  - Archive option for sent campaigns
  - Filter to find old campaigns

EXPECTED RESULT:
- Email campaigns can be deleted when appropriate
- Deletion requires confirmation
- Sent campaigns are protected/archived
- Scheduled campaigns are canceled if deleted
- Draft campaigns delete without issue
- Deletion is logged for audit
- Campaign history is preserved appropriately
- Bulk operations available for efficiency
