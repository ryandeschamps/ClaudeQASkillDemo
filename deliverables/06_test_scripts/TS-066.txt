TEST SCRIPT: TS-066
Test Scenario: Filter Orders by Status
User Story: As a Logged-in Admin, I want to filter orders by status (Open, Confirmed, In Process, Shipped, Delivered), so that I can focus on orders at specific stages
Priority: High
Related Requirements: FR-017

GIVEN the admin is logged into the admin panel
  AND the admin is viewing the orders list
  AND orders exist in various statuses

WHEN the admin selects "Open" status filter

THEN the system should display only orders with "Open" status
  AND update the order count to reflect filtered results

WHEN the admin selects "Confirmed" status filter

THEN the system should display only orders with "Confirmed" status

WHEN the admin selects "In Process" status filter

THEN the system should display only orders with "In Process" status

WHEN the admin selects "Shipped" status filter

THEN the system should display only orders with "Shipped" status

WHEN the admin selects "Delivered" status filter

THEN the system should display only orders with "Delivered" status

WHEN the admin selects "All" or clears the status filter

THEN the system should display all orders regardless of status

WHEN the admin applies multiple filters (status + date range)

THEN the system should display orders matching ALL filter criteria

EXPECTED RESULT:
- Status filter works correctly for all status values
- Filtered results are accurate
- Filter can be combined with other filters
- Order count updates with each filter change
- Filter selection is clearly visible
- Filter can be easily cleared to view all orders
- Page performance remains good with filtered results
- Admin can quickly focus on orders requiring attention
