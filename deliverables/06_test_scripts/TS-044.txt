Test Scenario: Change Password
User Story: As a Logged-in Buyer, I want to change my account password, so that I can maintain account security
Priority: High
Related Requirements: FR-010

GIVEN the user is logged in
  AND the user is on the account dashboard or settings page

WHEN the user navigates to "Change Password" section
  AND enters the following:
    - Current password
    - New password
    - Confirm new password
  AND clicks "Change Password"

THEN the system should:
  - Validate current password is correct
  - Validate new password meets requirements:
    * Minimum length (e.g., 8 characters)
    * Contains uppercase and lowercase
    * Contains numbers
    * Contains special characters
  - Validate new password matches confirmation
  - Update the password
  - Display success message
  - Optionally log out user and require re-login

WHEN current password is incorrect

THEN the system should display error message
  AND not update the password

WHEN new password doesn't meet requirements

THEN the system should display specific requirements
  AND highlight which requirements are not met

WHEN new password and confirmation don't match

THEN the system should display error message
  AND prompt user to re-enter matching passwords

WHEN password is changed successfully

THEN the system should send confirmation email to user
  AND optionally invalidate other active sessions

EXPECTED RESULT:
- Password change functionality works correctly
- Current password verification is enforced
- Password requirements are validated
- Password confirmation matching is checked
- Success notification is clear
- Confirmation email is sent
- Security: old password is required
- Updated password works for login immediately
