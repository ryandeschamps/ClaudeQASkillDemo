TEST SCRIPT: TS-089
Test Scenario: Edit Payment Information
User Story: As a Logged-in Admin, I want to update bank account details for receiving payments, so that I can ensure payments are received correctly
Priority: High
Related Requirements: FR-020

GIVEN the admin is logged into the admin panel
  AND the admin is on the payment settings page

WHEN the admin clicks "Edit Payment Information" or similar option
  AND modifies payment account details:
    - Bank account number
    - Account holder name
    - Bank name
    - Routing/IFSC code
    - Payment gateway API keys (if applicable)
  AND saves the changes

THEN the system should:
  - Validate all required fields are completed
  - Validate account number format
  - Validate routing/IFSC code format
  - Encrypt sensitive information
  - Update payment configuration
  - Display success confirmation message
  - Test connection with payment gateway (if applicable)

WHEN updating payment gateway credentials

THEN the system should:
  - Validate API keys with the gateway
  - Establish connection
  - Confirm successful integration
  - Update gateway status to "Connected"

WHEN validation fails

THEN the system should:
  - Display specific error messages
  - Indicate which fields have issues
  - Prevent saving invalid data
  - Keep previous configuration intact

WHEN changes are saved successfully

THEN future payments should be processed to the new account
  AND integration should work with updated credentials

WHEN the admin enters invalid API keys or credentials

THEN the system should:
  - Attempt validation
  - Display error message if invalid
  - Not save invalid credentials

EXPECTED RESULT:
- Payment information can be updated successfully
- All validations work correctly
- Sensitive data is encrypted and secured
- Gateway integration is tested after update
- Invalid data is rejected
- Success confirmation is clear
- Updated configuration takes effect immediately
- Previous settings are preserved if update fails
- Security: admin authentication required for changes
