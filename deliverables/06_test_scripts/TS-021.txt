Test Scenario: Remove Item from Cart
User Story: As a Logged-in Buyer, I want to remove items from my shopping cart, so that I can delete products I no longer wish to purchase
Priority: High
Related Requirements: FR-007

GIVEN the user is logged in
  AND the user has multiple items in their shopping cart
  AND the user is viewing the cart page

WHEN the user clicks the "Remove" button/icon for a specific item

THEN the system should:
  - Remove the item from the cart immediately
  - Update the cart display to show remaining items
  - Recalculate cart subtotal and total
  - Display a confirmation message (e.g., "Item removed from cart")
  - Optionally offer an "Undo" option for accidental removals

WHEN the user removes all items from the cart

THEN the system should display "Your cart is empty" message
  AND provide a link to continue shopping

WHEN the user clicks "Undo" (if available) after removing an item

THEN the system should restore the item to the cart
  AND recalculate totals

EXPECTED RESULT:
- Items are removed successfully
- Cart updates immediately
- Totals recalculate correctly
- Confirmation messages are clear
- Undo functionality works if implemented
- Empty cart state is handled properly
- User experience is smooth and intuitive
