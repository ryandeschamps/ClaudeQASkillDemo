TEST SCRIPT: TS-008
Test Scenario: Filter Product Listings
User Story: As a Visitor, I want to apply filters to product search results, so that I can narrow down options based on price, size, color, or ratings
Priority: High
Related Requirements: FR-004

GIVEN the user is viewing a product listing page
  AND multiple products are available
  AND filter options are displayed

WHEN the user selects a price range filter (e.g., $20-$50)

THEN the product listing should update to show only products within the selected price range
  AND the number of filtered results should be displayed

WHEN the user selects multiple filters (e.g., size "M" and color "Blue")

THEN the product listing should show only products matching ALL selected criteria
  AND filter selections should be clearly visible
  AND an option to clear filters should be available

WHEN the user clears a filter or clicks "Clear All"

THEN the product listing should update to remove the filter
  AND show the full unfiltered results

EXPECTED RESULT:
- All filter types work correctly (price, size, color, rating)
- Multiple filters can be applied simultaneously
- Filtered results are accurate
- Filter state is clearly indicated
- Clear filter functionality works properly
- Page updates are fast and responsive
- Result count updates with each filter change
