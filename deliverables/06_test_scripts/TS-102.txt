User Story: As a Logged-in Admin, I want to activate or deactivate sub-admin accounts, so that I can control system access
Priority: Medium
Related Requirements: FR-022

GIVEN the admin is logged into the admin panel
  AND sub-admin users exist with various statuses
  AND the admin is viewing the user management page

WHEN the admin clicks "Deactivate" for an active sub-admin
  AND confirms the action

THEN the system should:
  - Change sub-admin status to "Inactive"
  - Terminate any active sessions
  - Prevent future logins
  - Display success confirmation message
  - Send notification to sub-admin (optional)
  - Log the deactivation with reason and admin details

WHEN the deactivated sub-admin tries to log in

THEN the system should:
  - Deny login
  - Display "Account deactivated" message
  - Provide contact information for support

WHEN the admin clicks "Activate" for an inactive sub-admin
  AND confirms the action

THEN the system should:
  - Change sub-admin status to "Active"
  - Allow login access
  - Restore previous permissions
  - Display success confirmation message
  - Send notification to sub-admin (optional)
  - Log the activation

WHEN the reactivated sub-admin logs in

THEN they should have:
  - Full access restored
  - Same role and permissions as before deactivation
  - Access to all previously available features

WHEN viewing the sub-admin list

THEN inactive sub-admins should be:
  - Clearly marked with "Inactive" status
  - Distinguishable from active users
  - Filterable/sortable by status

EXPECTED RESULT:
- Deactivation prevents login immediately
- Active sessions are terminated
- Activation restores full access
- Status changes are reflected throughout system
- Sub-admins are notified appropriately
- Actions are logged for audit trail
- Access control is enforced correctly
- Status is clearly indicated in user list
