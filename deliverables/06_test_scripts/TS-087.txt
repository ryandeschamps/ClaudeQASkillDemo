TEST SCRIPT: TS-087
Test Scenario: Assign Product to Category
User Story: As a Logged-in Admin, I want to assign products to categories and sub-categories, so that I can organize products for customer browsing
Priority: High
Related Requirements: FR-018, FR-019

GIVEN the admin is logged into the admin panel
  AND categories and sub-categories exist
  AND the admin is creating or editing a product

WHEN the admin selects a category from the category dropdown
  AND optionally selects a sub-category

THEN the system should:
  - Assign the product to selected category
  - Assign to sub-category if selected
  - Allow selecting multiple categories (if supported)
  - Save the category assignment

WHEN the admin saves the product

THEN the product should:
  - Appear in the selected category on customer-facing site
  - Appear in sub-category if assigned
  - Be visible when customers browse that category
  - Be included in category product counts

WHEN the admin changes product category

THEN the product should:
  - Be removed from old category listing
  - Appear in new category listing
  - Update immediately on customer site

WHEN no category is selected

THEN the system should either:
  - Require category selection (validation error)
  - Allow saving but product won't appear in category navigation

WHEN the admin assigns to multiple categories

THEN the product should appear in all assigned categories

EXPECTED RESULT:
- Product category assignment works correctly
- Product appears in correct category on customer site
- Category changes are reflected immediately
- Sub-category assignment is optional but functional
- Multiple category assignment works (if supported)
- Category validation works appropriately
- Product organization is maintained
- Customer navigation reflects assignments
