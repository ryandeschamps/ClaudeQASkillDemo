TEST SCRIPT: TS-055
Test Scenario: Admin Logout
User Story: As a Logged-in Admin, I want to log out of the admin panel, so that I can secure the system when leaving my workstation
Priority: Medium
Related Requirements: FR-014

GIVEN the admin user is logged into the admin panel
  AND the admin is on any page within the admin panel

WHEN the admin clicks the "Logout" button or link

THEN the system should:
  - Terminate the admin session
  - Clear all authentication tokens and cookies
  - Redirect to admin login page
  - Display logout confirmation message (optional)

WHEN the admin tries to access admin pages after logout

THEN the system should redirect to admin login page
  AND require re-authentication

WHEN the admin clicks browser back button after logout

THEN the system should not allow access to admin pages
  AND should redirect to login page

WHEN the admin session expires due to inactivity

THEN the system should:
  - Automatically logout the admin
  - Display session expired message
  - Redirect to login page

EXPECTED RESULT:
- Admin is successfully logged out
- Session is completely terminated
- Authentication tokens are cleared
- Cannot access admin pages without re-login
- Back button doesn't expose admin content
- Session timeout works correctly
- Security: session is invalidated server-side
