Test Script ID: TS-071
Test Scenario: Test Data Changes in Roll Back Mode
Priority: High
Preconditions:
- Workbook upload functionality with rollback mode enabled
- Test/preview mode that doesn't commit changes
- Benefits administrator testing data updates before production
- Rollback mode clearly distinguished from commit mode
- Test results viewable without database changes

GIVEN: Benefits administrator needs to test benefits group changes before committing to production
WHEN: Administrator uploads workbook in rollback/test mode
THEN: Changes validated and previewed without committing to database, allowing error identification

Test Steps:
1. Benefits administrator preparing for organizational change
2. Workbook prepared with 200 benefits group updates
3. Want to test updates before committing to production
4. Administrator logs into Oracle Fusion HCM
5. Navigate to "Data Management" or "Workbook Uploads"
6. Click "Upload Workbook"
7. Select file: BG_Update_200_Employees_TEST.xlsx
8. Choose upload mode: "Roll Back Mode" or "Test Mode"
9. System displays rollback mode description:
   - "Changes will be validated but NOT committed to database"
   - "Use this mode to preview changes and identify errors"
   - "No actual data will be modified"
10. Click "Upload in Rollback Mode"
11. System processes file in test mode
12. Validation runs same as commit mode:
    - File format validation
    - Data integrity checks
    - Referential integrity validation
    - Business rule validation
13. Validation results displayed:
    - Total rows: 200
    - Valid rows: 195
    - Invalid rows: 5
14. Review error details for invalid rows:
    - Row 45: Person number not found (P999999 doesn't exist)
    - Row 78: New benefits group doesn't exist (BG-999 invalid)
    - Row 112: Effective date in past (2023-01-01 not allowed)
    - Row 156: Current benefits group mismatch (employee in BG-003, not BG-001)
    - Row 189: Duplicate person number (P100050 appears twice)
15. Download error report showing all failed rows
16. System displays test results summary:
    - "ROLLBACK MODE - No changes committed to database"
    - "195 rows would be processed successfully"
    - "5 rows have errors requiring correction"
17. Review what WOULD change (preview):
    - Employee P100001: BG-001 → BG-002 (PREVIEW ONLY)
    - Employee P100002: BG-001 → BG-002 (PREVIEW ONLY)
18. Verify database NOT actually changed:
    - Check employee P100001 current benefits group: Still BG-001 ✓
    - No actual updates committed ✓
19. Export test results report for review
20. Fix errors in workbook:
    - Correct invalid person numbers
    - Fix benefits group codes
    - Update effective dates
    - Remove duplicates
21. Reupload corrected file in rollback mode again
22. Validation passes: 200 valid rows, 0 errors
23. Now confident to proceed with actual update
24. Reupload file in "Validate and Process" mode (commit mode)
25. Changes successfully committed to database

Expected Result:
- Rollback/test mode clearly available and labeled
- Mode description explains no database changes will occur
- Validation runs identically to commit mode
- All errors identified and reported
- Error report downloadable for correction
- Test results show what WOULD change without committing
- Preview of changes available for review
- Database verification confirms no actual changes made
- Test results exportable for analysis and review
- Administrator can iterate testing until validation clean
- Errors corrected based on rollback mode feedback
- Confident transition from rollback to commit mode
- Actual processing successful after testing
- Testing prevents production errors and data corruption

Test Data Reference:
- Any bulk data update scenario
- Particularly important for large populations (100+ employees)
- Critical for first-time processes or new administrators

Notes:
- Verify rollback mode clearly distinguished from commit mode
- Confirm no database changes occur in rollback mode
- Test that validation identical between rollback and commit modes
- Verify error reporting comprehensive in rollback mode
- Ensure preview functionality shows intended changes
- Test iterative testing: upload, fix errors, reupload in rollback
- Confirm smooth transition from rollback to commit mode
- Verify rollback mode performance acceptable for large files
- Test that rollback mode accessible to all authorized users
- Ensure rollback mode recommended for new processes or large updates
