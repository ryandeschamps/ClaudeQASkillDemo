Test Script ID: TS-068
Test Scenario: Prorated Charges for Mid-Period Changes
Priority: Low
Preconditions:
- Proration rules configured for mid-period changes
- Life event or enrollment change occurred mid-billing cycle
- Proration calculation method defined (daily, by pay period, etc.)
- System calculates prorated premiums automatically
- Proration adjustments applied to billing

GIVEN: An employee adds spouse to coverage mid-month due to marriage life event
WHEN: System calculates prorated charges for partial month coverage
THEN: Charges successfully prorated based on coverage days, and accurate premium calculated

Test Steps:
1. Employee gets married on 2024-11-15
2. Reports marriage life event and adds spouse same day
3. Spouse coverage effective date: 2024-11-15 (marriage date)
4. Current billing cycle: November 2024 (November 1-30, 30 days total)
5. Employee's current coverage: Medical Employee Only ($185/month)
6. New coverage: Medical Employee + Spouse ($390/month)
7. Coverage change effective mid-month: November 15
8. Proration needed: November 1-14 (Employee Only) and November 15-30 (Employee + Spouse)
9. System calculates prorated charges
10. Proration calculation:
    - Employee Only period: November 1-14 = 14 days
    - Employee Only daily rate: $185 / 30 days = $6.17/day
    - Employee Only prorated: 14 days × $6.17 = $86.38
    - Employee + Spouse period: November 15-30 = 16 days
    - Employee + Spouse daily rate: $390 / 30 days = $13.00/day
    - Employee + Spouse prorated: 16 days × $13.00 = $208.00
    - Total November charges: $86.38 + $208.00 = $294.38
11. Benefits administrator reviews proration
12. Navigate to "Billing Adjustments" or "Prorated Charges"
13. Search for employee: Person Number or Name
14. Employee: Christopher Phillips, P100048
15. Review November billing with proration:
    - Original Employee Only charge: $185.00 (full month)
    - Proration adjustment: +$109.38
    - Final November charge: $294.38 (prorated for mid-month change)
16. Review proration calculation details displayed in system
17. Verify proration calculation accuracy:
    - Coverage change date: November 15 ✓
    - Days on Employee Only: 14 days ✓
    - Days on Employee + Spouse: 16 days ✓
    - Total days: 30 days ✓
    - Prorated total: $294.38 ✓
18. System generates prorated charge
19. November charges generated: $294.38
20. Employee receives billing statement showing proration:
    - "Medical Employee Only (Nov 1-14): $86.38"
    - "Medical Employee + Spouse (Nov 15-30): $208.00"
    - "Total November Premium: $294.38"
21. December billing (first full month with spouse)
22. December charges: $390.00 (full month Employee + Spouse rate)
23. No proration needed for December (full month at new rate)

- System automatically identifies mid-period coverage change
- Proration calculation triggered for partial month coverage
- Daily premium rate calculated correctly for each coverage level
- Days in each coverage period calculated accurately
- Prorated charges calculated correctly for each period
- Total prorated charge accurate: $294.38 for November
- Proration details visible and auditable
- Billing statement clearly shows proration breakdown
- Employee can understand prorated charges

Test Data Reference:
- Any mid-period enrollment change scenario:

- Test proration for multiple coverage changes in same month
- Confirm proration for termination mid-month (refund scenarios)
- Verify employee communication explains proration clearly
- Test proration for all benefit types (medical, dental, vision, life)
