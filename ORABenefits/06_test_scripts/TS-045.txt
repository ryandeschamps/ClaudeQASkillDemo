Test Script ID: TS-045
Test Scenario: Enrollment Suspension Due to Missing Document
Priority: Critical
Preconditions:
- Employee enrolled dependent requiring documentation
- Document upload deadline passed without submission
- Suspension rules configured for missing documents
- Employee notification process for suspensions
- Interim coverage rules defined

GIVEN: An employee enrolled a dependent but did not upload required documentation within deadline
WHEN: The document upload deadline passes without submission
THEN: Enrollment is suspended, employee is notified, and coverage is temporarily inactive until document provided

Test Steps:
1. Employee enrolled spouse in benefits on 2024-01-22 (Maria Rodriguez)
2. Action item created: Upload marriage certificate within 30 days
3. 30-day deadline: 2024-02-21
4. Employee does not upload document by deadline
5. System runs nightly suspension check batch process on 2024-02-22
6. Batch identifies employees with overdue required documents
7. System automatically suspends enrollment for spouse
8. Enrollment status changes from "Active" to "Suspended"
9. System generates suspension notification email
10. Employee receives email with subject: "Action Required - Coverage Suspended"
11. Email explains:
    - Spouse coverage suspended due to missing marriage certificate
    - Coverage can be reinstated by uploading required document
    - Instructions for document upload
    - Contact information for benefits team
12. Employee logs into self-service portal
13. Dashboard displays alert: "Your spouse coverage is suspended"
14. Navigate to benefits enrollment summary
15. See suspension indicator next to spouse coverage
16. Click for details: "Coverage suspended - marriage certificate required"
17. Navigate to action items
18. Action item shows: "OVERDUE - Upload marriage certificate"
19. Status: "Suspended - Immediate action required"
20. Review coverage implications: No active coverage until document approved
21. Employee uploads marriage certificate immediately
22. Document submitted for approval
23. After administrator approval, suspension lifted and coverage reinstated

Expected Result:
- System automatically identifies overdue required documents via batch process
- Enrollment automatically suspended when document deadline passes
- Enrollment status clearly marked as "Suspended"
- Suspension notification sent to employee via email and portal
- Notification clearly explains reason for suspension
- Instructions provided for reinstatement (upload document)
- Suspended status visible in benefits summary
- Coverage implications clearly communicated (no active coverage)
- Action item marked as "OVERDUE" with elevated priority
- Employee can still upload document after deadline passes
- Upon document upload and approval, coverage automatically reinstated
- Premium deductions may be adjusted based on suspension period
- Audit trail tracks suspension and reinstatement

Test Data Reference:
- Variant IDs: V006, V013, V019, V049, V095
- Test Data: Rows with Action_Item_Status: Suspended
  - Row 7 (P100006, Patricia Martinez): Suspended, Birth Certificate required
  - Row 14 (P100013, Daniel Taylor): Suspended, Marriage Certificate rejected
  - Row 20 (P100019, Steven Martin): Suspended, Adoption Papers pending

Notes:
- Verify suspension occurs automatically when deadline passes
- Confirm clear communication of suspension reason and resolution steps
- Test interim coverage rules if applicable (temporary coverage during review period)
- Verify suspension impacts coverage but not employee's eligibility
- Ensure premium implications clearly communicated (continue, suspend, refund)
- Test that suspension can be lifted immediately upon document approval
- Confirm retroactive coverage if document eventually approved
- Verify claims processing during suspension period (may be held or denied)
- Test employee communication emphasizes urgency without causing undue alarm
- Ensure benefits administrator can manually suspend or reinstate if needed
