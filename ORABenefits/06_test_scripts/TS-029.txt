Test Script ID: TS-029
Test Scenario: Open Enrollment - Default for Non-Participants
Priority: Critical
Preconditions:
- Open enrollment period has closed
- Some employees did not complete open enrollment
- Default enrollment rules configured
- Passive enrollment (keep current benefits) is the default action
- Administrator can run default processing batch job

GIVEN: Open enrollment closed on 2024-11-30 and some employees did not make elections
WHEN: Benefits administrator runs default enrollment processing after deadline
THEN: Non-participating employees have previous year's benefits carried forward automatically per default rules

Test Steps:
1. Open enrollment period ends: 2024-11-30 at 11:59 PM
2. Benefits administrator logs in on 2024-12-01
3. Navigate to "Open Enrollment Administration" work area
4. Click "Open Enrollment Reports" or "Participation Reports"
5. Run "Non-Participants Report" to identify employees who didn't complete enrollment
6. Review list of employees with no open enrollment elections submitted
7. Verify communication attempts were made (emails, reminders sent during OE period)
8. Navigate to "Default Enrollment Processing"
9. Select benefits group and plan year: 2025
10. Review default rules configured:
    - Medical/Dental/Vision: Passive enrollment (continue current elections)
    - FSA: No automatic enrollment (requires active election)
    - Life Insurance: Continue current coverage
11. Click "Process Default Enrollment" batch job
12. System processes all non-participants per default rules
13. Review batch job results showing:
    - Number of employees processed
    - Benefits continued by default
    - FSA elections not carried forward (require active election)
14. Verify individual employee records show "Passive Enrollment" status
15. Generate confirmation letters/emails to non-participants
16. Notification explains: "Your 2024 benefits continue for 2025 (except FSA)"
17. Review exception handling for employees requiring mandatory changes
18. Verify new year effective dates: 2025-01-01 for all default enrollments
19. Confirm premium deductions continue for non-participants
20. Generate audit report of default enrollment processing

Expected Result:
- Default enrollment batch job completes successfully
- All non-participating employees processed per default rules
- Medical, dental, vision coverage continues from prior year (passive enrollment)
- FSA does NOT continue automatically (requires active election)
- Life insurance coverage continues at same level
- All employees receive notification of passive enrollment
- Notification clearly explains what was continued and what wasn't (FSA)
- Coverage effective date: 2025-01-01 for all continued benefits
- Premium deductions continue unchanged for next year
- Audit report documents all default enrollment actions
- Employees can still make changes within special enrollment periods or life events

Test Data Reference:
- Variant IDs: V037, V061, V063, V091, V092, V093, V094
- Test Data: Multiple employees showing default enrollment
  - Enrollment_Method: Default Enrollment
  - Coverage continues from prior year
  - FSA not included

Notes:
- Verify passive enrollment is clearly communicated before open enrollment

- Test notification timing and content to non-participants
- Verify default rules are consistently applied across all employees
- Ensure employees understand passive enrollment consequences
- Test that benefit rate changes are applied even in passive enrollment
- Confirm employees can still make changes after default via life events
- Verify audit trail for all default enrollment decisions
