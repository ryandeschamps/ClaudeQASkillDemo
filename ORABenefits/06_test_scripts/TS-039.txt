Test Scenario: Administrator Back Out Life Event
Priority: Critical
Preconditions:
- Benefits administrator role with back out privileges
- Life event previously processed with enrollment changes
- Error identified requiring reversal of life event
- Back out functionality enabled
- Ability to reprocess life event correctly after back out

GIVEN: A life event was processed incorrectly and needs to be reversed
WHEN: Benefits administrator backs out the life event to reverse incorrect enrollments
THEN: Life event voided, enrollment changes reversed, and can be reprocessed correctly

Test Steps:
1. Identify life event that was processed incorrectly
2. Example: Marriage life event processed but wrong spouse added or wrong effective date
3. Benefits administrator logs into Oracle Fusion HCM
4. Navigate to employee's benefits record
5. Select "Life Events" or "Enrollment History"
6. Identify life event to back out: Marriage processed on 2024-06-20
7. Review life event details:
   - Event type: Marriage
   - Event date: 2024-06-15
   - Processed date: 2024-06-20
   - Enrollment changes: Added spouse, changed coverage to Employee+Spouse
8. Identify error: Wrong spouse name entered (data entry error)
9. Click "Back Out Life Event" or "Void Life Event"
10. System displays warning: "Backing out will reverse all enrollment changes"
11. System shows what will be reversed:
    - Spouse enrollment will be removed
    - Coverage will revert to Employee Only
    - Premiums will be adjusted back
12. Enter back out reason: "Wrong spouse added - data entry error, need to reprocess"
13. Confirm back out action
14. System processes back out:
    - Life event status changed to "Voided"
    - Enrollment changes reversed
    - Coverage reverts to pre-life-event state
    - Premium adjustments reversed
15. Verify employee's benefits show pre-life-event status
16. Verify premiums adjusted correctly (refund or credit if premiums already deducted)
17. Now reprocess life event correctly
18. Click "Report Life Event" for employee
19. Re-enter marriage life event with correct information
20. Add correct spouse with accurate information
21. Complete enrollment properly
22. Submit corrected life event
23. Verify audit trail shows: original life event, back out action, corrected reprocessing

Expected Result:
- Administrator successfully backs out incorrectly processed life event
- System requires confirmation before voiding to prevent accidental reversals
- Clear preview of what will be reversed before confirmation
- Back out reason captured for documentation
- Life event status changed to "Voided"
- All enrollment changes reversed to pre-life-event state
- Coverage levels reverted correctly
- Premium adjustments calculated and processed (credits/refunds if needed)
- Employee's benefits record shows correct current state
- Life event can be reprocessed correctly after back out
- Corrected life event processes successfully
- Audit trail captures: original event, back out action (reason, date, administrator), corrected event
- Employee notified of changes if necessary
