Test Script ID: TS-041
Test Scenario: Administrator Enter Overrides
Priority: High
Preconditions:
- Benefits administrator role with override entry privileges
- Enrollment error discovered after processing completed
- Override functionality for enrollment details enabled
- Ability to manually adjust coverage, premiums, effective dates
- Strong audit logging configured for override actions

GIVEN: An enrollment was processed with incorrect premium amount due to system error
WHEN: Benefits administrator manually overrides enrollment details to correct the error
THEN: Enrollment details successfully corrected, premium adjusted, and override documented in audit trail

Test Steps:
1. Identify enrollment error requiring manual correction
2. Example: System calculated wrong premium for family coverage ($625 instead of $680)
3. Benefits administrator logs into Oracle Fusion HCM
4. Navigate to employee's benefits enrollment record
5. Select problematic enrollment: Platinum HMO Family coverage
6. Review enrollment details:
   - Plan: Platinum HMO
   - Coverage level: Family
   - Current premium: $625.00 (incorrect)
   - Should be: $680.00 (correct)
7. Click "Override" or "Manual Adjustment"
8. System displays override screen with current values
9. Select field to override: "Premium Amount"
10. Enter corrected premium: $680.00
11. Enter override reason: "System rate table error - correcting to published family rate"
12. Attach supporting documentation: Rate schedule showing correct premium
13. Select override effective date: Start of coverage or next pay period
14. Review other fields for accuracy: coverage level, effective dates, dependents
15. Click "Submit Override"
16. System prompts for confirmation: "This will override system-calculated values"
17. Confirm override
18. System updates enrollment with overridden premium
19. Premium adjustment processed in billing system
20. Payroll notified of corrected premium amount
21. Employee notified of premium correction if significant
22. Verify audit log captures: field changed, old value, new value, reason, administrator, date
23. Generate override activity report for management review

Expected Result:
- Administrator successfully accesses enrollment override functionality
- Current enrollment details displayed clearly
- Override capability available for key fields (premium, coverage level, dates)
- Override reason required and captured
- Supporting documentation can be attached
- System validates override values for reasonableness
- Enrollment updated with overridden values
- Premium correction processed correctly
- Billing and payroll systems updated with corrected information
- Employee notification sent if material change
- Audit trail comprehensively documents: field, old value, new value, reason, approver, date
- Override activity reportable for management oversight
- Corrected enrollment now accurate and complete

Test Data Reference:
- Any enrollment with data errors requiring manual correction
- Common scenarios: wrong premium, wrong effective date, wrong coverage level, missing dependent
- Requires administrator with override privileges

Notes:
- Verify override functionality properly secured with authorization limits
- Confirm override reasons meaningful and selectable
- Test validation rules prevent unreasonable overrides
- Verify supporting documentation required for significant changes
- Ensure audit trail comprehensive for compliance and fraud prevention
- Test that overrides integrate properly with billing and payroll
- Confirm employee notification process for material changes
- Verify management oversight of override activity
- Test that overrides are tracked separately from standard enrollments
- Ensure override capability is exception-based, not routine correction method
