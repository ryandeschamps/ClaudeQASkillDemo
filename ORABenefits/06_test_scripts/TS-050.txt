10. Select bulk action: "Close Action Items"
11. System displays selection options:
    - Close all overdue action items

18. System processes bulk closure:
    - Updates all selected action items to "Closed - Deadline Expired"
    - Enrollments finalized with existing elections
    - Missing documents noted in enrollment records
19. System generates closure report showing:
    - Number of items closed
    - Affected employees
    - Impact on enrollments
20. Review employees affected by closures
21. Generate notification to affected employees:
    - Subject: "Open Enrollment Finalized"
