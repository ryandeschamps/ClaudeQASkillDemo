Test Script ID: TS-047
Test Scenario: Document Reuse Within Validity Period
Priority: High
Preconditions:
- Document previously uploaded and approved
- Document validity period configured (e.g., 12 months)
- System tracks document approval dates and expiration
- Reuse rules enabled for applicable document types
- New enrollment requiring same document type

GIVEN: An employee previously uploaded and had marriage certificate approved within past 12 months
WHEN: The employee enrolls spouse in additional benefit plan requiring marriage certificate
THEN: System automatically reuses previously approved document without requiring new upload

Test Steps:
1. Employee enrolled spouse in medical benefits 6 months ago (2024-05-01)
2. Uploaded marriage certificate - approved on 2024-05-05
3. Document validity period: 12 months from approval date
4. Document expiration date: 2025-05-05
5. During open enrollment (November 2024), employee decides to add spouse to dental coverage
6. Employee logs into self-service portal for open enrollment
7. Select dental plan and choose "Employee + Spouse" coverage
8. System checks for existing approved documents for spouse
9. System finds: Marriage certificate approved 2024-05-05, valid until 2025-05-05
10. System displays: "Marriage certificate on file (approved 2024-05-05)"
11. No new document upload required
12. Action item automatically marked as "Completed - Document Reused"
13. Employee proceeds with enrollment without uploading document again
14. Submit open enrollment elections including spouse on dental
15. System references existing approved marriage certificate
16. Enrollment processed successfully without document resubmission
17. Benefits summary shows: "Document on file - reused from previous approval"
18. Employee receives confirmation: "Spouse enrollment complete using previously approved documentation"
19. No interruption to coverage due to documentation
20. System tracks document reuse in audit trail
21. If enrollment occurs after expiration date (2025-05-06), system would require new upload

Expected Result:
- System automatically checks for previously approved documents
- Valid documents (within validity period) identified and reused
- Employee not required to upload same document multiple times
- Document reuse clearly communicated to employee
- Action item automatically satisfied using existing document
- Enrollment processes smoothly without document delays
- No coverage suspension or interim coverage needed
- Confirmation shows document was reused from previous approval
- Document expiration date tracked and enforced
- After expiration, new document required for future enrollments
- Audit trail documents document reuse with dates and reference to original approval
- User experience improved by eliminating redundant uploads

Test Data Reference:
- Variant IDs: V007, V018 (Document_Status: Reused)
- Test Data: Rows showing document reuse
  - Row 8 (P100007, David Brown): Marriage Certificate, Status Reused
  - Row 19 (P100018, Betty Harris): Birth Certificate, Status Reused

Notes:
- Verify document validity periods configured appropriately by document type
- Confirm reuse only applies to documents that don't expire quickly
- Test various document types: marriage certificates, birth certificates, etc.
- Verify system tracks approval dates and expiration dates correctly
- Ensure expired documents trigger new upload requirement
- Test that document reuse references original approval for audit purposes
- Confirm reused documents still subject to periodic re-verification if needed
- Verify multiple enrollments can reuse same document within validity period
- Test edge cases: document expires during enrollment process
- Ensure document storage secure and accessible for reuse validation
