Test Script ID: TS-034
Test Scenario: Administrator Override Eligibility
Priority: Critical
Preconditions:
- Benefits administrator role with override privileges configured
- Employee who does not meet standard eligibility criteria
- Management approval obtained for eligibility exception
- Override functionality enabled with proper security controls
- Audit logging configured for all override actions

GIVEN: An employee does not meet standard eligibility criteria but has management approval for exception
WHEN: Benefits administrator overrides eligibility rules to enroll ineligible employee
THEN: Employee successfully enrolled with override documented and audit trail captured

Test Steps:
1. Receive management approval to enroll employee who doesn't meet eligibility criteria
2. Example: Part-time employee (25 hours/week) when eligibility requires 30+ hours
3. Benefits administrator logs into Oracle Fusion HCM
4. Navigate to Benefits Administrator work area
5. Search for employee by name or person number
6. Review employee's current eligibility status: "Ineligible - Part-time status"
7. Click "Override Eligibility" or "Process Exception"
8. System displays current eligibility determination and rules
9. Administrator selects override option
10. System prompts for override reason code
11. Select reason: "Management Approved Exception"
12. Enter detailed override notes: "CEO approval dated 2024-11-01 - special circumstances"
13. Upload approval documentation (email, memo, etc.)
14. Select benefit plans to make available via override
15. Set override effective date and expiration date if applicable
16. Confirm eligibility override
17. System updates employee's eligibility status to "Eligible - Override"
18. Navigate to enrollment section for employee
19. Initiate enrollment with newly granted eligibility
20. Complete enrollment in approved benefit plans
21. Submit enrollment
22. Verify audit log captures override action with administrator ID, timestamp, reason

Expected Result:
- Benefits administrator successfully overrides eligibility rules
- Employee status changes from "Ineligible" to "Eligible - Override"
- Override reason documented in system
- Management approval attached to employee record
- Administrator notes captured explaining special circumstances
- Employee can now be enrolled in specified benefit plans
- Enrollment completes successfully despite not meeting standard criteria
- Audit trail captures: administrator ID, date/time, reason code, approval documentation
- Override flagged for future review or renewal
- System alerts if override expiration approaching
- Compliance team notified of eligibility exception if required

Test Data Reference:
- Any employee not meeting standard eligibility criteria
- Requires management approval documentation
- Administrator with override privileges required

Notes:
- Critical that overrides require proper authorization and documentation
- Verify strong audit trail for all eligibility overrides
- Confirm overrides are exception-based, not routine practice
- Test that override reasons are meaningful and selectable
- Ensure management approval documentation retained
- Verify periodic review of active overrides
- Test expiration date functionality for temporary overrides
- Confirm override cannot be performed without appropriate security role
- Validate compliance reporting includes override cases
- Test that overrides can be revoked if circumstances change
