Test Script ID: TS-014
Test Scenario: Dependent Age Out
Priority: High
Preconditions:
- Active employee with dependent child approaching age limit (typically 26)
- Age out notification process configured
- System monitors dependent birthdates and age limits
- Extension options available (disabled dependent, student status)
- COBRA notification process functional for aged-out dependents

GIVEN: An employee (Kimberly Lewis) has a dependent child turning 26 on 2024-09-01
WHEN: The system identifies the dependent aging out and notifies employee
THEN: Employee is notified of coverage termination and options for extension or COBRA continuation

Test Steps:
1. System automatically identifies dependent with birthdate approaching age limit
2. System generates age-out notification 60 days before dependent's 26th birthday
3. Notification sent to employee's email and appears in self-service portal
4. Log into self-service portal as employee (kimberly.lewis@company.com)
5. Review age-out notification for dependent
6. Notification explains: coverage will end on last day of month of 26th birthday
7. Review options presented: disabled dependent extension, student certification, COBRA
8. If dependent qualifies for extension (disabled or full-time student), follow extension process
9. If no extension applies, acknowledge age-out notification
10. Review updated coverage: Employee Only (dependent removed from coverage)
11. Verify premium adjustment calculated (reduced from Employee+Children to Employee Only)
12. System automatically updates coverage level on dependent's 26th birthday month end
13. New premium reflected: $175.00 (reduced from previous family or child coverage)
14. System generates COBRA notification to aged-out dependent
15. Dependent receives COBRA election information at their address
16. Verify dependent's coverage end date: last day of month turning 26 (2024-09-30)
17. Confirm employee's remaining coverage unchanged
18. Review premium reduction in next payroll cycle

Expected Result:
- Employee receives timely notification (60 days advance notice) of dependent aging out
- Clear explanation of coverage end date: last day of month of 26th birthday
- Options for extension clearly presented (disabled dependent, full-time student)
- If no extension, dependent automatically removed on age-out date (2024-09-30)
- Coverage level automatically adjusted to Employee Only
- Premium reduced from family rate to employee only ($175.00)
- COBRA notification sent to aged-out dependent with 60-day election period
- Employee can view updated coverage in self-service portal
- Payroll deduction reflects new premium amount
