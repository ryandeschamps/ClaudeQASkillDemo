13. System validates updated information:
    - Address format valid
    - ZIP code valid for state
    - Phone number format valid
    - Email format valid
14. Click "Save Changes"
15. System prompts: "Are you sure you want to update contact information?"
16. Confirm update
17. System saves changes
18. Confirmation message: "Contact information updated successfully"
19. Updated information displays in dependent list
20. Change history/audit trail captures: old values, new values, date, user

22. Updated information propagates to benefit plans and insurance carriers

Expected Result:
- Employee successfully accesses dependent edit functionality
- Current dependent information displayed for reference
- All contact fields available for editing
- Address, phone, and email fields accept valid updates
- Validation ensures updated information meets format requirements
- System prevents invalid entries (e.g., invalid ZIP code, malformed email)
- Confirmation prompt prevents accidental changes
- Changes saved successfully
- Updated information reflects immediately in dependent list
- Change history tracked for audit purposes (old values, new values, date, user)
- Updated information propagates to related systems (insurance carriers, provider networks)
- If address change significant, may trigger life event evaluation
- No disruption to active benefit coverage

Test Data Reference:
- Any employee with existing dependents
- Common update scenarios: address changes, phone updates, email changes
- Test Data: Use any row with Dependent_Names populated

Notes:
- Verify all contact fields can be updated except protected fields (SSN, DOB typically protected)
- Confirm validation rules appropriate for each field type
- Test that protected fields (SSN, DOB) require special authorization to change
- Verify change history comprehensive for audit and compliance
- Ensure address changes evaluated for HMO network implications
- Test that updates propagate to carrier systems appropriately
- Confirm bulk update capability if employee has multiple dependents at same address
- Verify email and phone validation accepts international formats if applicable
- Test that updates don't accidentally affect benefit enrollments
- Ensure updated information reflected on insurance ID cards if reissued
