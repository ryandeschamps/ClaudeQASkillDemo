Test Script ID: TS-040
Test Scenario: Administrator Reopen Life Event
Priority: Critical
Preconditions:
- Benefits administrator role with reopen privileges
- Life event previously closed (enrollment window expired)
- Valid reason to reopen life event for changes
- Reopen functionality enabled with audit logging
- Employee needs to make additional changes

GIVEN: An employee's life event enrollment window closed but they need to make additional changes
WHEN: Benefits administrator reopens the closed life event to allow changes
THEN: Life event reopened with new enrollment window, employee can make changes, and audit trail documents reopen

Test Steps:
1. Employee contacts benefits team: completed marriage enrollment but forgot to add spouse to dental
2. Marriage life event enrollment window closed 5 days ago
3. Benefits administrator logs into Oracle Fusion HCM
4. Navigate to employee's benefits record
5. Select "Life Events" tab
6. Review list of employee's life events
7. Identify closed life event: Marriage dated 2024-07-15, Status: "Closed"
8. Click on closed life event to view details
9. Review original enrollment: Spouse added to medical but not dental
10. Click "Reopen Life Event" button
11. System displays reopen confirmation dialog
12. System prompts for reopen reason
13. Enter reason: "Employee forgot to add spouse to dental - approved exception"
14. Specify new enrollment window duration: 14 days from reopen date
15. System displays: "Life event will be reopened. Employee can make changes until [date]"
16. Confirm reopen action
17. System updates life event status from "Closed" to "Reopened"
18. New enrollment window: Today through 14 days from now
19. System sends notification to employee:
    - Subject: "Your Marriage Life Event Has Been Reopened"
    - Body: "You can now make additional changes until [deadline date]"
20. Employee logs in and sees life event available for changes
21. Employee adds spouse to dental coverage
22. Employee submits updated elections
23. Administrator reviews and approves changes
24. Life event closes after new window expires
25. Verify audit trail documents reopen action, reason, and subsequent changes

Expected Result:
- Administrator successfully reopens closed life event
- Reopen requires documented reason for audit purposes
- New enrollment window duration specified by administrator
- Life event status changes from "Closed" to "Reopened"
- Employee receives notification that life event reopened
- New deadline communicated clearly
- Employee can access life event and make changes
- Original elections preserved, employee can modify as needed
- Updated elections process successfully
- Life event automatically closes again after new window expires
- Audit trail captures: reopen action, reason, administrator ID, date, new window dates
- All changes after reopen tracked separately
- Premium adjustments calculated for any new elections

Test Data Reference:
- Any life event that was previously closed
- Requires valid reason for reopening (employee error, administrator error, special circumstances)
- Administrator with reopen privileges required

Notes:
- Verify reopen functionality properly secured (not available to all users)
- Confirm reopen requires documented reason for compliance
- Test that reopened life events have configurable window duration
- Verify original elections preserved when reopening
- Ensure employee clearly notified of reopen and new deadline
- Test that life event automatically closes after new window
- Confirm audit trail comprehensive for compliance review
- Verify reopen should be exception-based, not routine practice
- Test that multiple reopens are logged if necessary
- Ensure billing and carrier implications of changes after reopen handled correctly
